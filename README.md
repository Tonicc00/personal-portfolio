## Overview

This site should use as a presentation of skills I acquired during my learning process, which still continues. 

Design is inspired by Windows OS and the idea is to allow users to navigate through site like they would on their desktop, for example double-click allows you to open the folder.

Hope you will have a great time exploring the site.

### FreeCodeCamp

This folder contains some exercises used in freeCodeCamp to teach their students syntax and get them familiar with writing code. It has practical approach to coding as well as great way of explaining theory combined with examples.

### FrontEnd Mentor

Frontend Mentor challenges are designed to help people create their own projects which seems like a great way of learning because the students have to find solutions to make their project work.

Here I listed few of the my best projects.

### React

React paired with JavaScript is a really fun tool to use as it simplifies the process tremendously. 

Restaurant landing page project is one I am most proud of as it was my first bigger project with react + successfully integrated recepies API and displayed data on UI.

### Windows

Windows button allows user to display windows tab and an option to shut down the portfolio. 

### Browser

Clicking the Google Chrome icon displays a browser with an option to play a dino game.

### Spotify

Clicking the Spotify icon displays a music player with few songs and options to play/pause song, skip song, rewind and adjust volume.

Twitter and Instagram open an external links to their respective sites and GitHub icon will lead you to my github account.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Git

### What I learned

I learned a lot about both creating a project from scratch and my skills and how I use them. There were a lot of steps on the way and I was stuck on some of them longer than I wanted. 

I also started using dev tools better to manipulate DOM which is also a real great way to test UI.

### Continued development

After every finished project, the best way to continue development is to start a new project. My plans are to create projects to add to this portfolio and make it richer.
